Ecommerce Performance Dashboard (Power BI) Case Study

Project Overview
I created a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard to analyse user behavior and marketing performance for an ecommerce store during November 2019. The Kaggle dataset is a real-world clickstream dataset. 

The dashboard tracks and visualises these key KPIs:
Total revenue
Revenue trend
User engagement
Conversion performance
Purchase funnel drop-off
Customer segmentation
Product and brand trends

Tools and Techniques used:
Power BI Desktop for visualization
Power Query for data cleaning and transformation
DAX for dynamic KPI calculations (e.g., revenue, conversion rate)
Custom visuals: funnel charts, bar charts, time series, KPI cards
Slicers and filters for interactivity (by date, user type, etc.)

Key Metrics Calculated with DAX:
Total Revenue	- Sum of price for all purchase events
Total Unique Users - Distinct count of user IDs
Revenue per User -	Revenue ÷ Total Users
LTV per User -	Total revenue from repeat buyers ÷ # of repeat buyers
Conversion Rate	- Purchases ÷ Views
Cart Abandonment Rate	- (Carts - Purchases) ÷ Carts
Average Order Value (AOV) -	Revenue ÷ Total Purchases
Repeat Purchase Rate -	Repeat Buyers ÷ Total Buyers

Insights & Observations found:

Funnel Performance - 
Total Views: approximately 64 million
Add to Cart: approximately 3 million
Purchases:  approximately 1 million
Conversion Rate: 1.44%
Cart Abandonment Rate: approximately 70%
Final funnel insights:
Only 1 in 3 users who add to cart end up purchasing, potentially because of pricing or UX issues.

Revenue Trends
Mid-month spike and steady growth seen; presents a potential for strategic promotions

Customer Behavior
Repeat customers made up approximately 12% of buyers, yet contributed significantly to total revenue.
LTV per user: $5,341.17
AOV: $300.12
Loyalty programs could be leveraged to increase return customer rate and grow LTV.

Product Insights
November’s top-purchased category: electronics.smartphone
Top brands: Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi, Huawei
A significant amount of purchases were from unmarked users; tag management intervention suggested to better track user behaviour 

Recommendations based on data
Run mid-month promotions to take advantage of existing revenue spikes
Offer incentives for abandoned carts e.g. discounts within 8-24 hours after leaving the site
Introduce loyalty systems to retain high-value repat customers and increase LTV
Explore customer segmentation to create personalised and targeted campaigns
